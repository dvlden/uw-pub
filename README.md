# UltraWideo Pub 🍻

### A place where you can discuss, vote, track, learn, etc.

UltraWideo cross-browser extension is no longer open-source. Why? Because it contains premium features and having it open-sourced in the past had no value.
I strongly believe that v3 and onwards will keep user's trust and security, even as a closed-source.

Decision to create a pub _(a place for all users)_ is now mainly for:

⚠️ [Issues](https://github.com/dvlden/uw-pub/issues) | 💭 [Discussions](https://github.com/dvlden/uw-pub/discussions) | 📋 [Planning](https://github.com/users/dvlden/projects/2) | 📚 [Learning](https://github.com/dvlden/uw-pub/wiki)

But later on, you'll be able to vote for the next features and that way contribute in its development.
